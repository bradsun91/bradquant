The proliferation of easily accessible data - both traditional and alternative - along with some very approachable frameworks for machine learning models - is encouraging many to explore the arena.\n",

    "However, usage of machine learning in stock market prediction requires much more than a good grasp of the concepts and techniques for supervised machine learning. As I describe further in [this post], stock prediction is a challenging domain which requires some special techniques to overcome issues like non-stationarity, collinearity, and low signal-to-noise.\n",

    "My system for handling data makes heavy use of three main types of data collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- features: This is a dataframe which contains all features or values which we will allow models to use in the course of learning relationships - and later making predictions. All features must be values which would have been known at the point in time when the model needed to make predictions.\n",
    "In other words, next_12_months_returns would be a bad feature since it would not become known at the time needed. The features dataframe has a multi-index of date/symbol and column names unique to each feature. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. outcomes: This is a dataframe of all possible future outcomes which we may be interested in predicting, magically shifted back in time to T-zero. For instance, we may want to predict the total_return for a symbol over the year following T=0 (the time of prediction). We would look ahead into the future, calculate what ultimately did happen to this metric, and log it onto time T=0. I'll explain why in a minute.\n",
    "Just like features, this dataframe has rows indexed by date/symbol and columns named with a convention which describes the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. master: The final data structure type is the master dataframe. This contains any static information about each symbol in the universe, such as the SIC code, the number of shares outstanding, beta factors, etc...\n",
    "In practice, things in the master may change over time (SIC codes and shares out can both change...) but I've found it sufficient for my purposes to take the current static values for the current point in time.\n",
    "This dataframe uses row index of symbol only. You could, of course, add a date/symbol index if you wanted to reflect changing values over time."

    "It may seem odd to split the features and outcomes into distinct dataframes, and odd to create a dataframe of several different possible \"outcomes\". Most important, it may seem odd to record on t=0 what will happen in the next day, week, month, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons for this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This makes it trivial to extract the X's and y's when training models. Just slice some columns from features for the X and slice one column of outcomes in y. They're already aligned and ready for fitting.\n",
    "- This makes it trivial to toggle between various time horizons - just change the column of outcomes used for y.\n",
    "- This helps us guard against inadvertent \"peeking\" at the future. We only ever use features columns in X.\n",
    "- This allows us to use the incredibly efficient pandas join, merge, and concat methods to quickly align data for purposes of training models.\n",
