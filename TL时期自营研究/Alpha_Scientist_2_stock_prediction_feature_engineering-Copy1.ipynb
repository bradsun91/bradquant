    "\n",
    "I believe (and I don't think I'm alone here!) that featue engineering is the most under-appreciated part of the art of machine learning. It's certainly the most time consuming and tedious, but it's creative and \"fun\" (for those who like getting their hands dirty with data, anyway...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is also one of the key areas where those with domain expertise can shine. Those whose expertise in investing is greater than their skill in machine learning will find that feature engineering will allow them to make use of that domain expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a term of art for data science and machine learning which refers to pre-processing and transforming raw data into a form which is more easily used by machine learning algorithms. Much like industrial processing can extract pure gold from trace elements within raw ore, feature engineering can extract valuable \"alpha\" from very noisy raw data.\n",

    "# Principles and guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is fundamentally a creative process which should not be overly constrained by rules or limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I do believe there are a few guidelines to be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No peeking: Peeking (into the future) is the \"original sin\" of feature engineering (and prediction modeling in general). It refers to using information about the future (or information which would not yet be known by us...) to engineer a piece of data. This can be obvious, like using next_12_months_returns. However, it's most often quite subtle, like using the mean or standard deviation across the full time period to normalize data points (which implicitly leaks future information into our features. The test is whether you would be able to get the exact same value if you were calculating the data point at that point in time rather than today.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the knowable: A corrolary to the above, you also need to be honest about what you would have known at the time, not just what had happened at the time. For instance, short borrowing data is reported by exchanges with a considerable time lag. You would want to stamp the feature with the date on which you would have known it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the table: Many machine learning algorithms expect that every input feature will have a value (of a certain type) for each observation. If you envision a spreadsheet where each feature is a column and each observation is a row, there should be a value in each cell of the table. Quite often, some features in the table will naturally update themselves more frequently than others. Price data updates almost continuously, while short inventory, analyst estimates, or EBITDA tend to update every few weeks or months. In these cases, we'll use a scheme like last observation carried forward (LOCF) to always have a value for each feature in the naturally lower frequency columns. Of course, we will be careful to avoid inadvertent peeking!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid false ordinality: Finally, it's extremely important to represent features in a way that captures ordinality only if it has meaning. For instance, it's usually a bad idea to represent \"day of the week\" as an integer 1 to 7 since this implicitly tells the model to treat Friday as very similar to Thursday, but \"a little more\". It would also say that Sunday and Monday are totally different (if Sunday =7 and Monday =1). We could miss all manner of interesting patterns in the data."

    "Another interesting application of this same pattern is to rank each stock cross-sectionally rather than longitudinally as above. In other words, where does this stock rank within all of the stocks on that day, not for all prior days of that stock. The below example isn't very meaningful with only two stocks, but quite useful when using a realistic universe. In this example, we're also making use of an earlier feature (relative volume) to compare which symbol is most heavily traded for that stock's normal range in a given day. Also note that we need to dropna() prior to ranking because rank doesn't handle nulls very gracefully."
